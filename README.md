** Project Description **

This was for a machine learning project I was working on with a group of my friends. We wanted to get experience building up our own Machine Learning Model because we found the concept of a computer utilizing the ability to learn to be so fascinating. The main issue is that there are so many levels and factors that come into play when training a data set, and also the pre-processing you need to do in order to allow the model to perform well. We found a data set on Kaggle that worked with credit card data, and went down the steps of splitting and analyzing the data, preprocessing and transformations, and finally choosing a model and performing hyper parameter optimization. One of the main problems we faced was when our model would perform poorly without an explanation, and we'd have to do research to identify the source of our problem. This required us to isolate each step of our process, identify possible areas of error, and generate possible solutions. Although the process may have been tedious, it allowed us to thoroughly understand the work we were doing, and feel proud of the progress we'd made.
